# MBOX

Welcome to this repository! Here, you'll find the C++ code for an interpreter of MBox, a custom object-oriented programming language. MBox is dynamically typed, interpreted, and currently under development. It draws significant inspiration from Robert Nystrom's Lox language.

If you want to run the interpreter, you can run the following code: 

    git clone https://github.com/MartinSantesteban/MBox.git
    cd MBox
    mkdir bin
    make binary
    ./bin/MBoxMain
